Version 2.0.0
 * Massive code restructure - each protocol has its own source file, making it 
   easier to add new protocols and examine and edit existing ones. Each 
   protocol has a priority level which determines the order that each set of 
   protocol rules will be matched by libprotoident. Stronger rules are given 
   higher priority than weaker ones (there are also instances where more common 
   protocols are given higher priority than less common ones where the rules
   are of similar strength).

 * To accommodate this change, the API has changed slightly:
   	* lpi_guess_protocol now returns a pointer to an lpi_module_t rather 
	  than an lpi_protocol_t. The lpi_module_t structure contains all the
	  info about the protocol that was matched, including the 
	  lpi_protocol_t for the matched protocol and the name string.
	* Added functions lpi_init_library(void) and lpi_free_library(void)
	  which initialise and destroy the protocol modules respectively. You
	  will need to call lpi_init_library before using any other 
	  libprotoident functions, and should call lpi_free_library when you 
	  are finished. See the tools if you need an example.

 * XML and AR files are no longer separate protocols - they now fall under the 
   file header category.
 
 * Improved rules for the following protocols:
 	MMS
	UDP Netbios
	TeamSpeak
	Quake
	DNS
	IRC
 
 * Added new protocols:
 	CVS
	Cisco VPN (TCP)
